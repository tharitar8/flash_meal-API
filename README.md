My idea of this project is I would like to have some place that everyone can come an upload or share their recipes of their dish that can cook under 15 -30 mins . The reason I came up with this idea because I like to cook and sometimes I'm in a rush (time is valuable). This app is for everyone that would like fast food but homemade.  Person that use this app can be everyone since a beginner or intermediate level of cooking skill

Routes will need to make the proper request to API

<!-- user_routes
     recipes_routes -->

```
-Time length: number
-name of the dish: 'string'
-recipes: 'string'
-steps how to: 'string' 
```
